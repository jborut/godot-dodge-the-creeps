# Dodge the Creeps!

This is a modified version of Godot initial game based on official [documentations](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/3.2/getting_started/step_by_step/your_first_game.html).

It is written with C# in Godot v3.2.

The difference between the version described in the documentation and this one is that here you also have bombs with which you can kill mobs. Also, the speed of mobs that gets spawned increases over time.

## How to play

To start the game from the menu simply press Enter. Before the game starts you will see instructions on how to move and place bombs.

Every second your score will increase by 1. If you kill the mob with a bomb you will get 10 more points. At the beginning you only have 5 bombs, but every 10 seconds, or if you kill mob, you will get one more bomb.

Once you get killed, the score and bombs number will remain visible until you start a new game.
